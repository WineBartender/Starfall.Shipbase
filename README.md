# Starfall.Shipbase
A Garry's mod simple E2 chip for creating ships that can roll, turn, and everything else. See README for how to setup.

Make sure you have Wiremod, Streamcore, and propcore installed. If you dont want steamcore, just simply remove the lines that use streamcore.

Additionally, if there are any errors. Just remove the lines that have the errors or the words that have errors.

Simply copy/paste the code from the txt file or drag the file into your garrysmod data expression folder by going to /common/garrysmod/garrysmod/data/expression2.

Ingame, place down the "Starfall.os_base" or whatever name you put it as. 

It will be facing towards north unless placed on a non-flat surface.

Spawn a seat and parent it to the ship, the chip will be large invisible plate unless changed.

Wire the seat from the chip to the chair. 

To activate the chip and start flying, get into the seat. Getting out will deactivate.

If you wish to add props onto the chip, remember to parent them without weight to the chip instead of welding.
